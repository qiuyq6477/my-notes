An entity is a collection of [1.2 Components](1.2%20Components.md).

Source file of [Entity](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/blob/master/Entitas/Entitas/Entity/Entity.cs):
```csharp
  public class Entity : IEntity, IAERC
  { 
    ....
   private IComponent[] _components;
    ....
   }
```
In entitas the entities hold an array of `IComponent`'s (for performance reasons).

Entities can be created and destroyed, destroying an entity also deletes all of it's components.
```csharp
var e = _context.game.CreateEntity();
e.Destroy();
```
They "live" on a specific context -> see [1.8 Contexts](1.8%20Contexts.md)

```csharp
[Game]
public sealed class PositionComponent : IComponent
{
    public IntVector2 Value;
}

void CreateDestroy(int x, int y)
{
    var entity = _context.game.CreateEntity();
    entity.AddPosition(new IntVector2(x, y));
    var pos = entity.position.Value;
    entity.RemovePosition();
}
```
Components can be added and removed, as long as the components context matches the entity's context.

To find a specific Entity a component with an [EntityIndex](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/wiki/Components#identifier) can be used.
