# Doctors

Doctors are special, existing outside the plugin pipeline.  Doctors are not run when generating code; they are run separately with either `Jenny doctor` to diagnose issues, or `Jenny fix` to fix them as well.

Doctor plugins generally exist to diagnose and fix problems with your project or configuration, but can operate directly on source code.
