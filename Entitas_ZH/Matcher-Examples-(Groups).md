Matchers are generated by the code generator and can be combined. Matchers are usually used to get groups of entities from the context of interest. Remember to prefix the matcher with the context name you are interested (e.g. GameMatcher, InputMatcher, etc). We will use GameMatcher for these examples.


***

Anything That Doesn't Have Component NotMovable
```
GameMatcher.AnyOf().NoneOf(GameMatcher.NotMovable)
```

***

Get a group of entities which have **Postion** and **Velocity** components but does not have **NotMovable** component.
```
GameMatcher.AllOf(GameMatcher.Position, GameMatcher.Velocity).NoneOf(GameMatcher.NotMovable));
```
