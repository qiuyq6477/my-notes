# Written Tutorials

## ["Hello, World!"](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/wiki/Unity-Tutorial-Hello-World)
This tutorial will teach how to create a simple "Hello World!" program in the Unity game engine with Entitas. The aim is to familiarize you with the different pieces that make up the Entitas framework, how they interact with each other, and how to structure your code inside an Entitas project. Best place to start if you're an experienced Unity developer that's new to Entitas.

## [Simple View and Movement](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/wiki/Unity-Tutorial---Simple-Entity-View-and-Movement) 
As part of this tutorial you will see how to represent game state in Entitas (as components) and how to render that game state using Unity functionality (via systems). You'll also see how to pass Unity user-input into components that other systems can react to and carry out related game logic. Finally you'll implement a very simple AI system that allows entities to carry out movement commands issued by mouse clicks.

## [MultiReactiveSystems](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/wiki/MultiReactiveSystem-Tutorial)
A simple tutorial to show you how to create MultiReactiveSystems - systems that operate over multiple contexts. These are extremely useful for boiler-plate systems that will be required throughout your game, and help eliminate the need for many separate systems that are identical but for the context-specific types declared in the code.

## [Communication Between Contexts](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/wiki/Inter-context-communication-in-Entitas-0.39.0)
An in depth example of how to create entities in one context that can then trigger behaviours in other contexts. Useful for input systems and networking where inputs are propagated across different players.

## [Entitas-lang](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/wiki/Tutorial-%E2%80%90-Entitas%E2%80%90lang)
This tutorial provides a brief introduction to using Entitas-lang with Entitas. In it you will learn how to install Entitas-lang and all required dependencies, then create a simple combat system with Entitas-lang where a player can attack enemies in the game by pressing the space bar.

## [Game Architecture With Entitas](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/wiki/How-I-build-games-with-Entitas-%28FNGGames%29) 
This is a blog by FNGGames discussing the way his projects are structured. Hopefully it provides some insight into broader architectural patterns for entitas-powered games.

## [Example Custom Code Generator Tutorial](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/wiki/Custom-Code-Generator-Tutorial)
An example custom code gerator built form start to finish, that makes use of custom attributes, data-providers and generates a set of files from tagged components. See also: [Custom Code Generator Tips and Tricks](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/wiki/Custom-Code-Generator-Tips-And-Tricks) for additional examples of things that can be done with the Roslyn generator.
