# Intro
There are many ways to handle the Lifecycle of a View with Entitas and Unity.
This article describes a very simple setup to link 1 entity with 1 view that might help you get started.

First we create an abstract class that each of our views can inherit from:
```csharp
public abstract class UnityView : MonoBehaviour
{
    protected Contexts Contexts;
    protected GameEntity LinkedEntity;

    public virtual void Link(Contexts contexts, GameEntity e)
    {
        Contexts = contexts;
        LinkedEntity = e;
        gameObject.Link(e);
    }
    
    public virtual void DestroyView()
    {
        Destroy(gameObject);
    }
}
```
The abstract class has to inherit from `MonoBehaviour` so we can attach it to a prefab.
Our views need access to the `LinkedEntity` in order to listen to changes in the entities components,
also we might want to react to global events so we get a connection to `Contexts` through the Link method.

The Link method basically also replaces the typical `Start()` and `Awake()` callbacks from unity.

With `gameObject.Link(e)` a `LinkedEntity` (unity)-component will be added to the gameObject providing you with a nice overview of the entities components.

# Usage
To create a visual representation of a player character that can move around,
we create a PlayerView that inherits from UnityView and attach it to a player-prefab.
```csharp
[Game, Event(EventTarget.Self)]
public class PositionComponent : IComponent
{
    public Vector3 Value;
}

public class PlayerView : UnityView, IPositionListener
{
    public override void Link(Contexts contexts, GameEntity e)
    {
        base.Link(contexts, e);
        e.AddPositionListener(this);
    }

    public void OnPosition(GameEntity entity, Vector3 value)
    {
        transform.position = value;
    }
}
```
Since we know the Player Entity has a `PositionComponent` attached to it and we generated an event system for position by adding the `Event(EventTarget.Self)` [Attribute](1.2%20Components.md#attributes), we can add a PositionListener to our View.

It is not a good practice to pass object references around with components, but to still be able to interact with the UnityView from within entitas this is a simple solution:
```csharp
public sealed class UnityViewComponent : IComponent
{
    public UnityView Value;
}
```

On Runtime we can then create a `PlayerView` like this:
```
var playerView = Object.Instantiate(_playerViewPrefab);
var e = _Contexts.game.CreateEntity();
playerView.Link(e); // passing the context is not needed anymore
e.AddUnityView(playerView.GetComponent<PlayerView>());
```

# Destruction
At some point our Player might die and we want to destroy it's entity and view / gameObject.
Or we want to load the next level and destroy every gameObject.
This is were a `DestroyedComponent` and `DestroySystem` come in handy.

```csharp
public sealed class DestroyedComponent : IComponent
{
}

public sealed class DestroySystem : ReactiveSystem<GameEntity>
{
    public DestroySystem(Contexts contexts) : base(contexts.game) { }

    protected override ICollector<GameEntity> GetTrigger(IContext<GameEntity> context) =>
        context.CreateCollector(GameMatcher.Destroyed);

    protected override bool Filter(GameEntity entity) => entity.isDestroyed;

    protected override void Execute(List<GameEntity> entities)
    {
        foreach (var e in entities)
        {
            if (e.hasUnityView)
            {
                e.unityView.Value.gameObject.Unlink();
                e.unityView.Value.DestroyView();
            }
           
            e.Destroy();
        }
    }
}
```
This system gets triggered for all entities flagged with the `DestroyedComponent`.
If there is a UnityView attached to an entity it calls `DestroyView()` first and then destroys the entity.

This gives you the opportunity to trigger an animation or pool the gameObject on destruction.

```csharp
public class PlayerView : UnityView, IPositionListener
{
    [SerializeField] private ParticleSystem _deathParticleSystem;

    public override void Link(Contexts contexts, GameEntity e)
    {
        base.Link(contexts, e);
        e.AddPositionListener(this);
    }

    public void OnPosition(GameEntity entity, Vector3 value)
    {
        transform.position = value;
    }
    
    public override void DestroyView()
    {
        _deathParticleSystem.Play();
        Invoke(nameof(DelayedDestroy), time: 1f);
    }
    
    private void DelayedDestroy()
    {
        base.DestroyView();
    }
}
```
In this example we play a particle system before actually destroying the gameObject one second later.
