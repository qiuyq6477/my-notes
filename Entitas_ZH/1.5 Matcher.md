A matcher is a way to describe what kind of entites we are interested in.

They can be used to create [1.7 Groups](1.7%20Groups.md) and [1.6 Collectors](1.6%20Collectors.md) <br>
Which in turn can be used as Filters in [Reactive Systems](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/wiki/Systems#reactivesystem) for example

Matcher are a small query language. `GameMatcher` means that we have a `Game` context and we can access all component types associated to this context. If we would write `context.GetGroup(GameMatcher.Position);` We would get a group of entites which have `Position` component. In order to define more complex groups, we can use `AllOf`, `AnyOf` and `NoneOf` methods. `AllOf` means that all the listed components has to be present on the entity in order for this entity to become part of the group. `AnyOf` means that one of the listed component has to be present. And in case of `NoneOf` we don't want the listed components to be present. `NoneOf` is not a stand alone description, meaning that you will not be able to write `context.GetGroup(GameMatcher.NoneOf(GameMatcher.Position));` It is prohibited because it creates a very large set. `NoneOf` can be used only in combination with `AllOf` or `AnyOf`.

```csharp
context.GetGroup(GameMatcher.AllOf(GameMatcher.Position, GameMatcher.Velocity).NoneOf(GameMatcher.NotMovable));
```
