On this page you will find a collection of example projects built with Entitas and the [Unity](https://unity3d.com/). 

***
### Notice!
The Match One example is regularly updated when a new Entitas version is released and is always up-to-date, but many of the other examples on this page were created with old versions of Entitas and may require extensive refactoring to get running with the most recent version of Entitas. Please consult the [upgrade guide](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/blob/master/EntitasUpgradeGuide.md) for help with this. It's also recommended to upgrade projects incrementally to avoid major compatibility problems.

## [» Match One (Entitas 1.4.1)](https://github.com/sschmid/Match-One)
<img align="right" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/develop/Readme/Images/Match-One.png" alt="Entitas-Match-One" height="240"> 

Simple CandyCrush-like game, except it's a match one. For an in-depth walkthrough of the project watch the [Unite Europe 2015 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1wvMXur19M4), but please be aware that starting with Entitas [0.36](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/releases/tag/0.36.0), **Pool** has been renamed to **Context**. So all mentions of the Pool in the video should now be interpreted as the Context when looking at the latest source code.

### Demonstrates
- Usage of Unity GameController to execute Entitas systems.
- How to use reactive systems to only process changed entities.
- Usage of EntityIndex for super fast entity access.
- How to use multiple contexts to reduce the memory footprint of each entity.

## [» RTS Template (Entitas 0.46.3)](https://github.com/ShadeSlider/Entitas-RTS-Template)
This project illustrates basic configuration management. Saving and loading configuration data through JSON. User input processing. Initializing entities from GameObjects in the scene, and much more!

## [» Sync Framework (Entitas 1.13.0)](https://github.com/RomanZhu/Entitas-Sync-Framework)
Networking framework for Entitas ECS. Targeted at turnbased games or other slow-paced genres. Automatically synchronizes all components on entities marked with Sync component. Additionally has networking Command messaging system.

## [» Network Template (Entitas 1.12.2)](https://github.com/proepkes/UnityLockstep)
This framework takes input from the network and translates it into commands. Pluggable services allow lots of customization for the simulation driven by Entitas. The core project has no dependencies to Unity. Unity only handles the visualisation part.

## [» Shmup (Entitas 0.35.0)](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-Shmup)
<img align="right" src="https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/raw/develop/Readme/Images/Entitas-Shmup.png" alt="Entitas-Shmup" height="320">

A basic Shoot 'Em Up made with Entitas. Watch the [Unite Europe 2016 talk](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lNTaC-JWmdI) to get an in-depth demonstration of how it all works, but please be aware that starting with Entitas [0.36](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/releases/tag/0.36.0), **Pool** has been renamed to **Context**. So all mentions of the Pool in the video now refer to the Context in the most recent version of Entitas. The [blueprints](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas-CSharp/wiki/Entitas-Blueprints) demonstrated here have also been deprecated.

### Demonstrates
- Usage of Unity GameController to execute Entitas systems.
- How to use reactive systems to only process changed entities.
- Usage of EntityIndex for super fast entity access.
- How to use multiple contexts to reduce the memory footprint of each entity.
- How to integrate external logic like Unity Physics and Input with Entitas.
- Unity GameObject pooling.
- Test driven development (TDD) with Entitas.
