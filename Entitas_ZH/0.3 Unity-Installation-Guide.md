This page contains detailed step-by-step instructions on setting up Entitas with the Unity game engine. If you still have questions after reading through this then please check out the [[0.1 FAQ]], ask for help in the [chat](https://discord.gg/uHrVx5Z), or crate a new issue.

# Step 1 - Prepare New Unity Project
Create and open a new Unity project. Then go to the Unity toolbar and select **Assets>Open C# Project**. This will open the default code editor associated with Unity and generate script assemblies needed by Entitas. You can then close or minimize the editor since we won't need it during setup.

>> Note: Some external editors do not automatically generate a `.csproj` file (e.g. Visual Studio, emacs, vim). If using one of these editors, ensure that a `.sln` and `.csproj` file have been created. Visual Studio will automatically do this if you have at least 1 C# script in your project.

### Optional
Create a new folder in the root of your Unity project to hold the Entitas add-on. This is commonly named "Libraries" or "Plugins" in most examples, but you can name it anything you want.

# Step 2 - Import and Setup Entitas
Download the latest **Entitas.zip** found in [Releases](https://github.com/sschmid/Entitas/releases/) then open it and drag and drop the folder named `Entitas` (located under Assets/Entitas) into the folder you created earlier or into the root of your Unity project. You may also need the folder named `DesperateDevs`.

Wait for Unity to reload and you should now see a new section on the toolbar titled **Tools**, select that and choose **Jenny > Preferences** to open the preferences window.  This is the preferences window for **Jenny**, the code generator.

In the Jenny preferences window press the button labeled **Auto Import**. You will then see a warning message, just select **Continue and overwrite** and all settings in the preferences window should now be automatically setup for you.

# Step 3 - Test Code Generator
Press the big green button labeled **Generate** in the preferences window or use the hotkey **Shift+Ctrl+G** to verify that everything is setup correctly and to generate your first code. 

If everything is working you should see a message in the console and a new folder inside your Unity project containing all generated files. By default this is located at **Sources/Generated**. If you get an error message instead, please read the [[0.1 FAQ|FAQ]] for solutions to common issues.

## All done. You're awesome! ðŸŽ‰ðŸ˜‰
Congratulations! You are now all ready to start creating amazing things with Entitas and Unity! To learn how to start making components, systems and game logic, check out the [[0. Tutorials]] and [Examples](0.5%20Example-projects.md) sections.

## Troubleshooting ##
If your Tools->Entitas menu shows only `migrate...`, check that you have all the contents of release.zip/Assets/ somewhere inside your assets directory. In version 1.7, not having the `DesperateDevs` folder will cause this problem on Windows.
