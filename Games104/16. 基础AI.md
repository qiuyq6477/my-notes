	- Map representation
		- Walkable Area
			- We need to tell AI agents where they can walk â€“ Walkable area
			- Walkable area of players is determined by character motion capabilities
				- Physical Collision
				- Climbing slope/height
				- Jumping distance
			- Simulating movement of AI agents as players costs too much
			- AI agents are still expected to have the same walkable area as players
	- Path finding
	- Path smoothing
