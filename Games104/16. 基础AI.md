### Navigation
- Navigation Steps
	- Map representation
		- Walkable Area
			- We need to tell AI agents where they can walk – Walkable area
			- 同一个地图对于不同的agent可行走区域可能是不一样的，比如士兵和坦克，飞机
			- Walkable area of players is determined by character motion capabilities
				- Physical Collision
				- Climbing slope/height
				- Jumping distance
			- Simulating movement of AI agents as players costs too much
			- AI agents are still expected to have the same walkable area as players
			- 可行走区域表达形式
				- Waypoint Network
					- Network connecting critical points (waypoints) from the map
					- Waypoint sources: 
						- Designed important locations 
						- Corner points to cover walkable area 
						- Internal points to connect near-by waypoints adding flexibility to navigation
					- Usage of waypoint network is similar to subway system
						- Find the nearest points to get on and off the network
						- Plan the path on the waypoint network
					- Pros:
						- Easy to implement
						- Fast path finding, even for large maps 
					- Cons: 
						- Limited flexibility: must go to the nearest point in the network before navigation 
						- Waypoint selection requires manual intervention
				- Grid 
					- Intuitive discretization of map
					- Uniform subdivision into small regular grid shapes
					- Common grid shapes 
						- Square
						- Triangle 
						- Hexagon
					- Grid property could be modified in runtime to reflect dynamic environmental changes
					- Pros: •
						- Easy to implement 
						- Uniform data structure 
						- Dynamic 
					- Cons: 
						- Accuracy depends on grid resolution
						- Dense grid lowers pathfinding performance，格子很密集的话，效率会低，因为线性的存储方式导致cache miss
						- High memory consumption 
						- Hard to handle 3D map，很难表达层次结构，比如桥
				- Navigation Mesh
					- Solves the problem of representing overlapped walkable areas 
					- Approximates the walkable area of character controller based on physical collision and motion capabilities
					- Lowers network density to boost pathfinding performance
					- Convex Polygon of NavMesh
						- Pathfinding generates a series of polygon (Polygon Corridor) need to walk through
						- Convexity guarantees the final path is limited in the polygon and two adjacent polygons have only one common edge (Portal)（两个凸多边形之间只会有一个公共边）
						- 寻路的时候要穿过一个凸多边形，只会穿过一次，如果是凹多边形，可能会有多次
					- Pros: 
						- Support 3D walkable surface 
						- Accurate （精确）
						- Fast in pathfinding 
						- Flexible for selection of start/destination 
						- Dynamic 
					- Cons: 
						- Complex generation algorithm 
						- Not support 3D space（不能给直升飞机这种agent寻路）
				- Sparse Voxel Octree（八叉树）
					- Represents “flyable” 3D space
					- Similar to spatial partitioning
					- Finest level voxels represents complicated boundary
					- Coarser-level voxels represents uniform regions
					- 存储比较费？
					- 寻路比较麻烦？
	- Path finding
		- Distances in map representations can be abstracted as edge costs in graph![[Pasted image 20230122131030.png]]
		- Pathfinding can be abstracted as shortest path problem in non-directional graph
