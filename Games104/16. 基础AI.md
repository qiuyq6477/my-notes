### Navigation
- Navigation Steps
	- Map representation
		- Walkable Area
			- We need to tell AI agents where they can walk – Walkable area
			- 同一个地图对于不同的agent可行走区域可能是不一样的，比如士兵和坦克，飞机
			- Walkable area of players is determined by character motion capabilities
				- Physical Collision
				- Climbing slope/height
				- Jumping distance
			- Simulating movement of AI agents as players costs too much
			- AI agents are still expected to have the same walkable area as players
