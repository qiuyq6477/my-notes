### Network Protocols
- How to communication between two PCs
	- A and B must agree on the meaning of the bits being sent and received at many different levels, including 
		- How many volts represents a 0 bit, and for a 1 bit? 
		- How does receiver know which is the last bit? 
		- How many bits long is a number?
- Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)
	- Connection-Oriented 
	- Reliable and Ordered 
	- Flow Control 
	- Congestion Control
- UDP Features
	- Connectionless 
	- UnReliable and Unordered 
	- NO Flow Control 
	- NO Congerstion Control
- TCP VS UDP![[Pasted image 20230124104503.png]]
- Reliable UDP
	- TCP is Not Time Critical
		- TCP is the complex and heavyweight protocol. It provides reliable delivery and advanced features, but it has more overhead 
		- TCP is a fair, traffic oriented protocol designed to improve bandwidth utilization. But it's not designed for speed
	- UDP is Fast but Unreliable
		- UDP is lightweight and fast but unreliable, packet loss and disorder will occur 
	- Why We Need to Customize Protocol
		- Game Server（对于服务器来讲，需求如下） 
			- Keep-alived connection (TCP) 
			- Need keep logic consistency in “order” (TCP) 
			- High responsive & low latency (UDP) 
			- Broadcast commonly used (UDP) 
	- 实现方式
		- Acknowledgement & Sequence Number
			- Positive acknowledgment (ACK) is a signal that is passed between communicating processes, computers, or devices to signify acknowledgment, or receipt of message •
			- Negative ACK (NACK or NAK) is a signal that is sent to reject a previously received message or to indicate some kind of error 
			- Sequence number (SEQ) is a counter used to keep track of every byte sent outward by a host 
			- Timeouts specified periods of time allowed to elapse before an acknowledgment is to be received
		- Automatic Repeat Request (ARQ)
			- An error-control method for data transmission that uses ACK and timeouts to achieve reliable data transmission over an unreliable communication channel. 
			- If the sender does not receive an acknowledgment before the timeout, it re-transmits the packet until it receives an acknowledgment or exceeds a predefined number of retransmissions 
				- Sliding window protocol 
					- Stop-and-Wait ARQ 
					- Go-Back-N ARQ 
					- Selective Repeat ARQ
			- what is Sliding window protocol
				- Send mutilple frames at a time, number of frames to be sent is based on Window size 
				- Each frame is numbered by Sequence number 
				- When the frame at the front of the window is received, the window slides![[Pasted image 20230124105806.png]]
				- 窗口滑动策略
					- Stop-and-Wait ARQ
						- Windows size = 1 
						- After transmitting one frame, the sender waits for an ACK before transmitting the next frame 
						- If the ACK does not arrive after a certain time, the sender times out and retransmits the original frame 
						- Poor utilization of bandwidth, poor performance![[Pasted image 20230124105914.png]]
					- Go-Back-N ARQ
						- N is Sender's Windows Size 
						- The Receiver only sends cumulative ACK 
						- If an ACK is not received within an agreedupon time period, all frames in the current window are transmitted![[Pasted image 20230124110016.png]]
					- Selective Repeat ARQ
						- In Selective Repeat ARQ, only the damaged or lost frames are retransmitted 
						- The receiver sends the ack of each frame, and the sender maintains the timeout time of each frame 
						- When receiver receive damaged packet, it will send a NACK, The sender will send/retransmit frame for which NACK is received![[Pasted image 20230124110042.png]]
		- Make UDP Reliable in Packet Loss Scenario
			- With the increase of packet loss rate and delay, the reliable UDP can not meet the transmission requirements gradually.eg.If packet loss rate increase to 20%, use reliable UDP is still with high delay
			- Forward Error Correction (FEC)
				- The transmission of enough additional redundant information with the primary data stream to reconstruct lost IP packets up to a certain extent
