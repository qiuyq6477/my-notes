- Character，Control，Camera


### Event Mechanism
作用：
- Abstract the world communication to messages
- Decoupling event sending and handling
实现方式：
- Publish-subscribe Pattern
	- Publisher categorizes published messages (events) into classes
	- Subscriber receive messages (events) that are of interest without knowledge of which publishers
	- 3 Key Components of Publish-subscribe Pattern
		- Event Definition
			- 需要是可以让用户自定义添加事件，通过代码生成和反射实现。也可以是生成脚本或者数据。
			- Event Type
			- Event Argument
		- Callback Registration
			- Time points of registration and execution differs，可能导致触发事件的时候对象不存在了
			- Object Strong Reference
				- 强引用关系，比如说内存依赖
				- Prevent object from de-allocation as long as callback function still registered
			- Object Weak Reference
				- 弱引用关系，比如指定范围内的攻击目标
				- Object could be de-allocated, and will check callback function if valid
		- Event Despatching
			- Send event to appropriate destination
			- Event Dispatch : Immediate![[Pasted image 20230121215047.png]]
				- Deep well of callbacks
				- Blocked by function，中间可能被事件打断，而这个事件可能很费时间，导致卡顿。
				- Difficult for parallelization
			- Event Queue
				- Basic Implementation
					- Store events in queue for handling at an arbitrary future time
				- Event Serializing and Deserializing
					- 利用反射，把事件序列化成二进制
					- To store various types of events![[Pasted image 20230121215535.png]]
				- Event Queue
					- Ring buffer![[Pasted image 20230121220451.png]]
					- Batching![[Pasted image 20230121220431.png]]
				- Problems of Event Queue
					- Timeline not determined by publisher
						- 当把事件进行分类后，事件的执行顺序就被打乱了
						- 事件需要支持在被发布后，什么时机执行，pre tick，tick，post tick
					- One-frame delays
						- 因为插入到队列里面去了，延迟了一帧执行

### Game Logic
- Compiled language(mostly C/C++)
	- Compiled to machine code with high performance
	- More easier to use than assembly language
- Problem of Compiled Languages
	- Game requirements get complex as hardware evolves
		- Need quick iterations of gameplay logic
	- Issues with compiled language
		- Need recompilation with even a little modification
		- Program can easily get crashed with incorrect codes
	- Glue Designers and Programmers
		- Get rid of inefficient communication between designers and programmers
		- Designers need direct control of gameplay logic
		- Artists need to quickly adjust assets at the runtime environment
- Scripting Languages
	- 优点
		- Support for rapid iteration
		- Easy to learn and write
		- Support for hot update
		- Stable, less crash by running in a sandbox
	- 缺点
		- The performance is usually lower than compiled language
			- Weakly typed language is usually harder to optimize when compile
			- Need a virtual machine to run the bytecode
			- JIT is a solution for optimization
		- Weakly typed language is usually harder to refactor（弱类型语言更难重构）
	- Object Management between Scripts and Engine
		- Object lifetime management in native engine code
			- Need to provide an object lifetime management mechanism
			- Not safe when script uses native objects (may have been destructed)
		- Object lifetime management in script
			- The lifetime of objects are auto managed by script GC
			- The time when object is deallocated is uncontrolled (controlled by GC)
			- Easy to get memory leak if reference relations get complex in script
	- Architectures for Scripting System
		- Native language dominants the game world
			- Most gameplay logic is in native code
			- Script extends the functionality of native engine code
			- High performance with compiled language
			- 引擎占主导![[Pasted image 20230121223438.png]]
		- Script language dominants the game world
			- Most gameplay logic is in script
			- Native engine code provides necessary functionality to script
			- Quick development iteration with script language
			- 脚本占主导地位![[Pasted image 20230121223411.png]]
	- Hot Update
		- Allow modifications of script while game is running
			- Quick iteration for some specific logic
			- Enable to fix bugs in script while game is online
		- A troublesome problem with hot update
			- All variables reference to old functions should be updated too
- Make a Right Choice of Scripting Language
	- Things need to be considered
		- Language performance
		- Built-in features, e.g. object-oriented programming support
	- Select the proper architecture of scripting
		- Object lifetime management in native engine code or script
		- Which one is dominant, native language or script


### Visual Scripting
- Visual Script is a Program Language
	- Variable
		- Preserve the data to be processed or output 
		- Type 
			- Basic type, e.g. integer, floating
			- Complex type, e.g. structure 
		- Scope
			- Local variable 
			- Member variable
		- Variable Visualization - Data Pin and Wire
			- Use data wires through data pins to pass variables (parameters)
			- Each data type uses a unique pin color
			- ![[Pasted image 20230121230638.png]]
	- Statement and Expression
		- Use nodes to represent statements and expressions
	- Control Flow
		- Control the statement execution order
			- Sequence
			- Conditional
			- Loop
			- Use execution wires through execution pins to make statements sequence
			- Use control statement nodes to make different control flow
			- ![[Pasted image 20230121230906.png]]
	- Function
		- A logic module which take in data, process it and return result(s)
			- Input Parameter 
				- The data required input to be processed 
			- Function Body 
				- Control how to process data 
			- Return value(s)
				- The data to be returned
			- Use a graph with connected nodes to make a function
			- ![[Pasted image 20230121231027.png]]
	- Class (for object-oriented programming language)
		- A prototype for a kind of objects
			- Member Variable
				- The lifetime is managed by the object instance
			- Member Function 
				- Can access member variables directly
				- Maybe overrided by derived classes
			- Use blueprint to define a class that inherits from a native class
				- Event Callback Functions 
				- Member Functions 
				- Member Variables
- Visual Script Debugger
	- Provide user-friendly debug tools for visual scripting
- Issues with Visual Scriping
	- Visual script is hard to merge for a team work
		- Usually a visual script is stored as a binary file
		- Manually reorder script graph is inefficient and error-prone even with a merge tool
	- The graph can get pretty messy with complex logic
		- Need uniform graph layout rules for a team work
- Script and Graph are Twins![[Pasted image 20230121233349.png]]


### “3C” in Game Play
- What is 3C？
	- 3C: Character, Control & Camera 
	- 3C is the primary element that determines the gameplay experience
- Character
	- In-game character, both player and npc. Include character movement, combat, health, mana, what skills and talents they have, etc. 
	- One most basic element of a character is movement.
- Control
	- Different input device 
	- Different game play
- Camera: Subjective Feelings
	- Camera Basic：POV & FOV
		- POV (point of view)
			- determines the position of the player to observe 
		- FOV (field of view)
			- determines the size of the player's viewing Angle
